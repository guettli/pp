I am looking for an open source font which is easy to read for children.

**Character differentiation (hard requirements):**
- `I` `l` `1` must be easy to differentiate
- Lowercase `l`: must have a curved tail (hooks to the right at the bottom)
- Uppercase `I`: must have horizontal strokes at top and bottom (serifs), with rounded ends
- Number `1`: should have a flag/serif at the top or a base to distinguish it

**Style:**
- Serif, but slightly and rounded.
- Slightly rounded terminals/corners
- Should not look handwritten or overly playful

**Technical:**
- Open source (e.g., SIL Open Font License)
- Easily embeddable into HTML (e.g., available on Google Fonts)

Maybe a bit like this font: https://opendyslexic.org/

But it looks too strange/different.

"Grounding" would be good, so that the chars look stable. Imagine the chars a real world shapes.
They should not fall over when wind comes.
