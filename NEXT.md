Introduction: Below are tasks. Implement them. Just look at the first task.

After it is implemented run `task deploy`. If errors if needed.

When deploy was succcessful, then create a new file in the directory "done":

done/YYYY-MM-DD-brief-task-explanation.md

Move the task from NEXT.md to this file.

Add a summary.

Do `git commit -m "brief-task-explanation".

Then take the next task. Tasks are seperated by three dashes.

IPA of "Le ballon de foot" contains strange chars

Create automated test, so that this does not happen again. Check all ipas of all phrases of all
langs before deploy.
