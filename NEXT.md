Introduction: Below are tasks. Implement them. Just look at the first task.

After it is implemented run `task deploy`. If errors if needed.

When deploy was succcessful, then create a new file in the directory "done":

done/YYYY-MM-DD-brief-task-explanation.md

Add this done-file to git.

Move the task from NEXT.md to this file.

Add a summary.

Do `git commit -m "brief-task-explanation".

Then take the next task. Tasks are seperated by three dashes.

Why en-US here?

"en-GB": { voice: "en-US-AndrewNeural", source: "edge-tts-andrew" },

Currently only en-GB is supported. Fix that.
