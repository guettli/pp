Introduction: Below are tasks. Implement them. Just look at the first task.

After it is implemented run `task deploy`. If errors if needed.

When deploy was succcessful, then create a new file in the directory "done":

done/YYYY-MM-DD-brief-task-explanation.md

Move the task from NEXT.md to this file.

Add a summary.

Do `git commit -m "brief-task-explanation".

Then take the next task. Tasks are seperated by three dashes.
