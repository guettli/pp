- Phoneme recognition still bad. How to fix??? Write test, adjust parameters?
- structure words differently: WORD/LANG/ in WORD dir is the icon. This way all languages use the
  same icon.
- after record button release wait .5s, and then stop recording. Sometimes the last sound is cut.
- Phonem-Analyse: always fine: ✓ [f] → [l] ✓ [uː] → [a] ✓ [s] → [l]
